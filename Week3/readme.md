# Exercise 7 solution

## Getting started

Al the source code can be found under `credit` and `message` folders.
To check the result we can run:

1) from the root folder `docker-compose` up`

2) if you want to use local source files you will need to comment lines in docker-compose.yml

**HINT:** you may have some other docker images already running on the same ports, if so you will need to stop them.
i.e. `docker stop exercise3_messageapp_1`

**HINT:** If you don't want to test locally your code you can always run the server from docker by uncommenting the lines in docker-compose.yml
